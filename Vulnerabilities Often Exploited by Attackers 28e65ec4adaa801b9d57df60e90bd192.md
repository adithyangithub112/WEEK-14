# Vulnerabilities Often Exploited by Attackers

## **1. Unpatched Software**

- Systems or applications missing security updates.
- Attackers exploit known CVEs to gain access or run malicious code.
- **Impact:** System compromise, data theft, remote code execution.
- **Mitigation:** Enable automatic updates, maintain patch cycles.

---

## **2. Weak or Reused Passwords**

- Simple, predictable, or repeated passwords across accounts.
- Enables brute-force, credential stuffing, and dictionary attacks.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized login and lateral movement.
- **Mitigation:** Strong password policy, MFA, password rotation.

---

## **3. Open or Unnecessary Ports**

- Unneeded services left running and reachable.
- Attackers scan these ports to find entry points.
- **Impact:** Exposure of internal services and vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation:** Disable unused ports, enforce firewall filtering.

---

## **4. Outdated or Insecure Protocols**

- Use of protocols like FTP, Telnet, HTTP that transmit in plaintext.
- Easy for attackers to intercept or manipulate traffic.
- **Impact:** Credential theft, session hijacking.
- **Mitigation:** Replace with SSH, SFTP, HTTPS.

---

## **5. Misconfigured Access Controls**

- Excessive privileges or incorrect permission settings.
- Attackers escalate their privileges after initial access.
- **Impact:** Access to sensitive files or systems.
- **Mitigation:** Least-privilege principle, periodic access audits.

---

## **6. Default Credentials Unchanged**

- Factory usernames/passwords left on devices or apps.
- Attackers try widely known default combinations.
- **Impact:** Full system takeover.
- **Mitigation:** Change defaults during setup.

---

## **7. Insecure APIs or Web Applications**

- Lack of validation, broken authentication, exposed endpoints.
- Leads to SQL injection, XSS, CSRF and more.
- **Impact:** Data leaks, unauthorized actions, remote code execution.
- **Mitigation:** Secure coding, WAF, regular penetration testing.

---

## **8. Misconfigured Cloud Services**

- Public buckets, weak IAM roles, exposed keys.
- Attackers exploit cloud misconfigurations to access or steal data.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, account compromise.
- **Mitigation:** Proper IAM configurations, access restrictions, enable logging.
